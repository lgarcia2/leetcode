This was a quick and easy problem to solve. It was very straightforward and when thinking of a solution, I put pen to paper, so to speak, and the code flowed freely.

The only things that gave me any sort of trouble on this was Python syntax. I'm still coming from a c# background so some of the differences trip me up a little bit. Here are the syntax items that tripped me up.
- Python uses `elif` instead of `else if`
- I tried to use the syntax `for i in range 0..len(nums)`. I'm not sure where I learned the `0..len(nums)` its probably an artifact of playing with some other programming language and mistaking the syntax. Its not often I end up using for loops with iterators in Python, I can usually reach for a `for thing in list` type of syntax. For this problem though, I had to explicitly return the index of the numbers AND avoid using the same instance of the number twice. Regardless, I'm happy to have more practice with the syntax.
